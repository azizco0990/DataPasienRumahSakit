## Context
Hospitals and healthcare facilities often face the complex task of managing their patient data.
Along with technological developments, electronic data storage has become the standard for managing patient information. Therefore, a simple application is needed that can help in managing patient data. This program aims to provide an easy-to-use and efficient solution to overcome challenges in patient data management in hospitals.

In this context, we will explain a simple program that allows hospitals or other health facilities to manage their patient data well. This program includes basic functions such as adding new patient data, displaying existing patient data, updating patient information, and deleting patient data if necessary. Apart from that, this program also provides the option to search patient data by name or age, as well as sort patient data based on selected criteria.

This program is expected to increase efficiency and accuracy in patient data management, ensure that patient information is easily available, and facilitate better searching and updating of patient data.

## Business Tasks
This program was created to manage hospital patient data. This program allows hospitals or medical staff to manage patient data. They can add new patient data, view existing patient data, update patient information, and delete patient data if necessary. This program helps organize hospital patient data in a structured and easily accessible manner. With this program, important information such as patient name, age, and address can be organized and searched easily. This program helps improve efficiency in patient data management in hospitals, ensures patient data is well organized and easy to access, and facilitates better searching and updating of patient information.

## Key Values
-Sorting patient data by name and age.

-Filtering Data by ID, Name, Gender and Disease.

## Stakeholders
-Hospital Manager

-Medical Officer

## Limitations
1. Feature Limitations. The program does not include complex features such as highly detailed electronic medical records management or integration with other systems in the hospital.

2. Data Security: This program does not focus on very high data security. For hospitals that store sensitive patient data, stronger protection against unauthorized access is needed.

3. Limited Scalability: The program may not be able to handle very large amounts of patient data well. When hospitals manage thousands or millions of patients, more robust and scalable systems are needed.

4. Integration with Other Systems: This program does not address integration with other systems used in the hospital. Patient data often needs to interact with other systems such as laboratories, medical imaging, and appointment management.

## Data Summary
This dataset represents patient data from a hospital. This dataset consists of 6 columns that include the following information:

1. Patient ID: This column contains the unique identification number for each patient. Patient ID is used to identify and differentiate each patient in the hospital system.

2. Patient Name: This column contains the full name of each patient. Patient names are used to personally identify patients and are used in medical documents.

3. Patient Age: This column contains the age of each patient at the time the data was collected. Patient age information is important in determining appropriate medical treatment and in categorizing patients by age group.

4. Gender: This column contains the gender of each hospital patient. This information is useful for calculating the comparative number of patients between men and women

4. Patient Address: This column contains the patient's residential address or contact address. The patient's address is used to contact the patient if necessary and also for administrative purposes.

5. Disease: This column contains the disease currently being experienced by the patient. This information is used to group patients based on the disease they suffer from.

This dataset can be used by hospitals for patient data management, medical care planning, reporting, and statistical analysis. This information can help in providing better and more efficient care to patients and ensure that medical data is stored properly and securely.
